# Contribution Guide

Contributions are welcomed and highly appreciated!

We welcome pull requests. When contributing new features or bug fixes, please
1. Check your code style with `pre-commit` (see below).
2. Add unittests if possible.
3. Remove all (accidentally included) sensitive data or information.
4. Have sensible PR title.
5. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA"). You will be reminded by a GitHub bot after creating a PR if you haven't.

## Setup development environment

You can install extra requirements for development by running

```sh
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
