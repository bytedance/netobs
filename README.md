# NetObs

Calculate observables from neural network&ndash;based VMC (NN-VMC).

Currently, NetObs has built-in suport for [FermiNet](https://github.com/google-deepmind/ferminet) (molecular systems) and [DeepSolid](https://github.com/bytedance/DeepSolid) (solid systems). We are planning to add support for more neural network VMC frameworks, and it's also very easy to write your own [adaptor](#adaptor) to make NetObs support your network!

The currently supported observables include energy, electron density, interatomic force, stress, [etc.](netobs/observables) More observables are on the way, and it is also very easy to write your own!

## Installation

Clone this repository and run an editable installation:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

Please don't forget to install the NN-VMC code and the corresponding version of JAX beforehand.
NetObs is tested with [`google-deepmind/ferminet@e94435b`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/ferminet/commit/e94435b15ca73a6c5404cdd399916290990e340b)+`jax@0.4.24` and [`bytedance/DeepSolid`](https://github.com/bytedance/DeepSolid/)+`jax@0.2.26`.

## Command Line Example

NetObs comes with a friendly command-line app, making it easy for a quick try. An example command would be:

```shell
netobs @ferminet_vmc tests/data/H_atom.py @force:SWCT --with steps=20 --net-restore tests/data/H_atom.npz
```

A short explanation of the arguments:

- `@ferminet_vmc` specifies the [`Adaptor`](#adaptor). The `@` sign is a shortcut to access built-in `Adaptor`s, `Estimator`s, etc. `@ferminet_vmc` stands for the `DEFAULT` object in module `netobs.adaptors.ferminet_vmc`. Another example would be `my_module:MyAdaptor`.
- `tests/data/H_atoms.py` is a Python module or file that contains a `get_config` function. If you have a custom `Adaptor`, it can be anything your `Adaptor` recognizes.
- `@force:SWCT` specifies the [`Estimator`](#estimator). `@force:SWCT` means the `SWCT` class in the `netobs.observables.force` module.
- `--with steps=20` specifies the [options for NetObs](#options).
- `--net-restore ...` tells the `Adaptor` where to restore the network checkpoint.

Another example with DeepSolid:

```shell
netobs @deepsolid_vmc tests/data/H_chain.py @energy --with steps=20 --net-restore tests/data/H_chain.npz
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use the SWCT force estimator with DeepSolid, it is highly recommended to use the [`tri` feature](https://github.com/bytedance/DeepSolid/pull/3).

## Core Concepts

### Adaptor

`Adaptor` is an abstract layer over the network that exposes a uniform API. For example, it tells NetObs how to restore from a checkpoint, evaluates the network and Hamiltonian, etc.

Currently, we have built-in support for FermiNet (molecules) and DeepSolid (solid systems). You can find their implementation in [netobs/adaptors](netobs/adaptors). It is also very easy to write your own adaptors!

### Estimator

You can regard estimators as different ways to estimate a physical quantity given a set of Monte Carlo samples. You can have multiple estimators for an observable, but usually a basic one is enough.

In the code, an `Estimator` tells us what type of observable it targets at, the expression of the estimator given a set of Monte Carlo samples, how to combine the results from different steps (simply averaging or more actions are required), etc.

An `Estimator` can work only in the molecular case, or it can be implemented to support molecules and solids at the same time. Check out the `SWCT` `Estimator` in [force.py](netobs/observables/force.py) for more.

You can find the implementation of built-in estimators in [netobs/observables](netobs/observables). And it is easy to create your own estimator!

## Options

- `steps` (int, default to `10`): Steps to run inference.
- `mcmc_steps` (int, default to `10`): Steps to run MCMC.
- `mcmc_burn_in` (int, default to `100`): Burn-in steps for MCMC.
- `random_seed` (int, default to current time): The random seed for the Monte Carlo simulation.
- `log_interval` (int, default to `10`): Time interval in seconds between logs.
- `save_interval` (int, default to `600`): Time interval in seconds between saves.
- `estimator` (dict): Options for the estimators.
- `observable` (dict): Options for the observable.

## Integrate in Your Code

You need to pass your `Adaptor`, `Estimator` class, and evaluate options to [`netobs.evaluate.evaluate_observable`](netobs/evaluate.py). For example,

```python
from netobs.helpers.importer import import_module_or_file
from netobs.observables.force import SWCT

cfg = import_module_or_file("H_chain.py").get_config()
adaptor = DeepSolidVMCAdaptor(cfg, [])
options = NetObsOptions(steps=20)
digest, all_values, state = evaluate_observable(adaptor, SWCT, options=options)
```

For more details, check out [this test](tests/numerical_test.py) for how to start an evaluation, and check out [this test](tests/adaptor_test.py) for how to use different adaptors in your code.
